    "\n",
    "2. Why Scaling is important and we do it.\n",
    ">Scaling matters because features with large numerical ranges can dominate model learning, even if they are not more important. Scaling ensures fair contribution from all features\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why we separated Features and Target Variables into X and Y respectively.\n",
    ">We separate X (features) and y (target) because supervised learning trains a model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. Mixing them would cause data leakage and invalidate training and evaluation.<br>\n",
